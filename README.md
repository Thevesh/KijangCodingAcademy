# KijangCodingAcademy

The files are organised into 3 different kinds:
  a) basics - these are code demonstrations of basic skills / java functions that you'll need
  b) algos - these are demonstrations of algorithms that every coder should know
  c) projects - these are things we're building in order to work on our coding skills because BUILDING IS THE BEST PRACTICE
  
How to Go About It:
  a) Begin with the basic files. See what's being done. Try and replicate it.
     Over the next few weeks, I'll insert a proper, fleshed-out set of instructions here.
  b) Work through the algorithms. Ask the people who came for the lessons what went down.
  c) Build!

Things to build (as of 31/7/17):
1) BMI calculator
2) Angle Between Clock Hands calculator
3) Day of the Date calculator
