# KijangCodingAcademy

There are 3 types of files:
1. basics - these are code demonstrations of basic skills / java functions that you'll need
2. algos - these are demonstrations of algorithms that every coder should know
3. projects - these are things we're building in order to work on our coding skills because BUILDING IS THE BEST PRACTICE
  
How to Go About It:
1. Begin with the basic files. See what's being done. Try and replicate it. Over the next few weeks, I'll insert a proper, fleshed-out set of instructions here.
2. Work through the algorithms. Ask the people who came for the lessons what went down.
3. Build!

Things to build (as of 31/7/17):
